Since AChoirX is a complete re-write of AChoir in Go, there are some things 
that will not make it into the initial release (and some may not make it at
all).  This is due to the (un)availability of certain native functions in 
GoLang, and because the goal of AChoirX is to have parity on Widows, Linux, 
and OSX as much as possible.

For this reason, AChoirX will rely much more on external funtionality than
AChoir did.


Some of the Functions that will not be in the initial release:
==============================================================
* Raw NTFS
* NTP
* Console Colors
* Check for Windows Escalated Privs
* Check for Memory Size
* Native SMB/CIFS



Some New Additions/Changes:
===========================
* Native HTTP/HTTPS (GoLang has a GREAT HTTP/S library)
* Use TSK for Raw File Collection
