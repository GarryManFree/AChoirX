Since AChoirX is a cross-platform port of AChoir in Go, there are some things 
that will not make it into the initial release (and some may not make it at
all).  This is due to the (un)availability of certain native functions in 
GoLang, and because the goal of AChoirX is to have parity on Widows, Linux, 
and OSX as much as possible.

For this reason, AChoirX will rely much more on external funtionality than
AChoir did.


Some of the Functions that will not be in the initial release:
==============================================================
* Raw NTFS
* NTP
* Console Colors
* Check for Windows Escalated Privs
* Check for Memory Size
* Native SMB/CIFS



Some New Additions/Changes:
===========================
* Native HTTP/HTTPS (GoLang has a GREAT HTTP/S library)
* Native UnZip
* Use TSK for Raw File Collection
* Native S3 File upload using the AWS SDK for Golang
* Native Encryption

Some Notes:
===========
AChoirX has native support for S3 File Upload.  I HAVE NOT built in native support
for SFTP, SCP, or other upload protocols because clients for those protocols are 
readily available for all platforms.  If you want to use other upload protocols, 
AChoirX can execute those client programs by using EXE: or SYS:
