# Manifest Tool (mt.exe)



In order to auto Escalate AChoirX Privileges to Admin (required for many of the functions of AChoirX), download the Manifest Tool (mt.exe) located in the Windows SDK, and apply a manifest that escalates the AChoirX executable(s) to Admnistrator.



After installing the Windows SDK, mt.exe will be located within the Windows Kits directory, usually at a path similar to:

C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\<SDK\_Version>\\x64 (for 64-bit systems)

or

C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\<SDK\_Version>\\x86 (for 32-bit systems)



where <SDK\_Version> represents the specific version number of the installed SDK. 



I have included X86 and AMD64 manifest and config files that work for me.
